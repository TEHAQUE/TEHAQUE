## About

I develop websites and desktop applications, primarily using React and Rust/Tauri. Recently I've been getting into gamedev, 3D modeling, and graphics programming with Unity and WebGL.

Note: Most of my projects are private — my code was stolen in the past. Previews are available below. If you want to see something specific or need help, feel free to reach out.
